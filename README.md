# Svelte Terminal

This project is a very basic terminal emulator built with SvelteKit. It mostly acts as a homepage with bookmark "commands".

I actually use this regularly as my browser homepage. I built the original version in 2017 with plain JavaScript. In 2022 I decided to convert it to SvelteKit mostly to learn Svelte.

## New features to add

- Search command
- Tab autocomplete
- clear command
